<b> Key Characteristics of News:  </b>
<hr />
<b>Timeliness: </b>

News is often characterized by its relevance to the present moment. Events that have recently occurred or are currently unfolding are typically considered newsworthy.
<b> Relevance: </b>

The significance of the news to its audience plays a crucial role. News is relevant when it affects or interests a significant portion of the public. This includes political decisions, economic changes, or social issues that impact peopleâ€™s lives.
<b> Accuracy: </b>

Credible news sources prioritize accuracy, ensuring that the information provided is factual and verified. This helps maintain trust with the audience and upholds journalistic integrity.
<b> Objectivity: </b>

News aims to present information without bias, allowing the audience to form their own opinions. Objectivity in reporting involves presenting multiple perspectives and avoiding editorializing.
<b> Proximity: </b>

Events that occur closer to the audience are often more newsworthy. Local news, for instance, holds more immediate interest for a local audience than international news, unless the latter has a direct impact on them.
<b> Prominence: </b>

News often involves notable individuals or organizations, such as political leaders, celebrities, and major corporations. These stories attract attention due to the high profile of the subjects involved.
<b> Conflict: </b>

News frequently includes elements of conflict or controversy, as these are inherently more engaging and consequential. Stories involving political disagreements, legal battles, or social issues often make headlines.
<b> Human Interest: </b>

Stories that appeal to emotions, such as tales of heroism, survival, or human achievement, are considered newsworthy because they resonate on a personal level with readers or viewers.
<b> Novelty: </b>

Unique or unusual events can also be newsworthy. Stories that are unexpected or surprising tend to capture attention because they deviate from the norm.
<hr />

In-depth articles that explore a particular topic or issue in detail. These stories provide background information and context, going beyond the immediate facts to offer analysis and insight.
<b> Investigative News: </b>

These reports uncover deeper truths about a subject, often involving detailed research and fact-checking. Investigative journalism aims to reveal hidden issues or hold entities accountable.
<b> Editorials and Opinion Pieces: </b>

Unlike objective news, these articles provide commentary, opinions, or perspectives on current events or topics. They often reflect the viewpoints of the writer or publication.
<b> Human Interest Stories: </b>

These focus on individuals or communities and their experiences, often highlighting personal stories that evoke empathy or emotional responses.
<b> Weather Reports: </b>

News updates about weather conditions, forecasts, and any significant climate events affecting daily life.
